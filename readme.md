# üîç SBERT and TFIDF Post Retrieval System

This is a Gradio-powered application that retrieves similar posts based on an input post or a custom query.  
It supports three different retrieval techniques:

- **SBERT (Sentence-BERT) Pretrained**
- **SBERT Fine-Tuned** on custom data
- **TFIDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**

You can select any method and explore how each technique retrieves similar posts from the dataset!

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Sample Posts**: The app randomly selects 5 posts from the dataset.
2. **View Recommendations**: Click "See Similar Posts" to retrieve related posts based on the selected method.
3. **Custom Query**: You can also input your own text to find similar posts dynamically.
4. **Performance Metrics**: Each retrieval shows live metrics like Precision@5, Recall@5, F1 Score, MRR, and NDCG.
5. **Global Evaluation**: Displays the overall performance of each retrieval method.

## üìö Models and Indexes Used

- `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from SentenceTransformers (Pretrained SBERT)
- Custom Fine-Tuned SBERT Model
- TFIDF Vectorizer trained on the dataset
- FAISS indexes for fast similarity search (cosine similarity)

## ‚ö° Instructions to Use

1. Select a retrieval technique (SBERT, SBERT Fine-Tuned, or TFIDF).
2. Browse sampled posts and click on a post to find similar ones.
3. Alternatively, input your own custom text and search.
4. View retrieval results along with live evaluation metrics.
5. Compare methods to explore retrieval performance!
